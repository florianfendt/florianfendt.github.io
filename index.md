# About

I am a Masters student in Statistics at LMU Munich. Besides studying I'm
working at our department's working group Computational Statistics lead
by Prof. Bernd Bischl. My job mainly consists of organizing the course in
Computational Statistics. I'm responsible for improving as well as creating
lecture slides and holding the tutorial each week to recap the lecture
and solve mathematical and programmatical exercises with our students.
Besides teaching, the other part of my job is to contribute
to the R-package mlr (see Projects), created by my Professor Bernd Bischl.
Besides loving my profession I also like travelling
and the art of photography, well when I find the time.

# Projects

- [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr)
  Machine Learning in R
  R package that provides a unified user interface for machine learning
  experiments.
- [shiny-mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr_shiny)
  Graphical user interface that wraps the functionality of mlr in a web app.
  I started this project together with
  [Stefan Coors](https://github.com/Coorsaa) as a students project.
  Both of us love it so much, we can't stop enhancing and improving the app
  to make it competetive with other similar applications (which are mostly
  not open source, so please give as a hug if you like using it ;))
