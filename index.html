  <div class="mypar">
  <p>
    I am a Masters student in Statistics at LMU Munich.
    Besides studying I'm working at our department's working group
    Computational Statistics lead by Prof. Bernd Bischl.
    My job mainly consists of organizing the course in
    Computational Statistics.
    I'm responsible for improving as well as creating
    lecture slides and holding the tutorial each week to recap the
    lecture and solve mathematical and programmatical exercises
    with our students.
    Besides teaching, the other part of my job is to contribute
    to the R-package mlr (see Projects), created by my Professor
    Bernd Bischl.
    Besides loving my profession I also like travelling
    and the art of photography, well when I find the time.
